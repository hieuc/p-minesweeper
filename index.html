                <b>So how do we traverse through the mine field safely?</b> <br>
                <h4>1. Apparent moves</h4>
                Sometimes the moves we can make are very apparent, require no calculations. 
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/apparent-case.png">
                    <img src="./images/apparent-case-solved.png">
                    <figcaption>An apparent case</figcaption>
                </figure>
                In this case, the second <img src="./assets/1.png"> tile only has 1 open neighbor (surrounding tiles), thus, this one must be a mine. <br>
                With a mine exposed, we can infer that all other open neighbors of first and third <img src="./assets/1.png"> tiles are safe to explore, since the mine is already accounted for. <br>
                From there, we can deduct two simple rules to make a safe guess:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the value of tile equals to the number of its open neighbors, all of them are mines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the number of known mines surrounding a tile equals to its value, then all of its open neighbors are safe.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2. Computed moves</h4>
                Though those are solid rules to make guesses, they are not nearly enough to advance the game.
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/computable-case.png">
                    <img src="./images/computable-case-marked.png">
                    <img src="./images/computable-case-solved.png">
                    <figcaption>A harder case</figcaption>
                </figure>
                Notice that the above rules can't be applied in this case. We can still make some safe guesses, but it involves some calculations. <br>
                Let's assign all the tiles surrounding known tiles as <b>x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,... x<sub>i</sub></b> each has a value of either <b>1</b> or <b>0</b>, where 1 signals a mine, 0 otherwise.<br>
                We know that each known tile reveals how many mines in its neighbor. The 3 known tiles would give this set of equations:
                <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> = 1</li> 
                    <li>x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub> + x<sub>4</sub> + x<sub>5</sub> = 2</li>  
                    <li>x<sub>4</sub> + x<sub>5</sub> = 1</li> 
                </ul>
                3 equations but 5 variables, that's not enough! In fact, most cases we encounter would not give enough equations to solve all variables, but the set can be solved partially. <br>
                To do this in a general way, we convert the set into a matrix and transform it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_echelon_form#Reduced_row_echelon_form">Reduced Row Echelon</a> form (RREF).
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/matrix1.png">
                    <img src="./images/matrix1-rref.png">
                    <figcaption>Matrix form and Reduced Row Echelon form</figcaption>
                </figure>
                From the RREF matrix, we can see that x<sub>3</sub> = 0, meaning this tile is safe to explore. <br>
                Since the domain of variable is restricted to only 0 or 1, we can make inference on some non-obvious equations:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the value is 0 and all other coefficients are non-negatives, then all variables with non-zero coefficients are 0. <br>
                        <u>Example:</u> 
                        <img src="./images/heuristic1.png"> => x<sub>2</sub> = x<sub>4</sub> = 0
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the sum of all positive coefficients equals to the value, then all positive coefficients are 1s and negative ones are 0s. This also applies to the opposite sign. <br>
                        <u>Example:</u>
                        <img src="./images/heuristic2.png"> => x<sub>2</sub> = x<sub>4</sub> = 1; x<sub>3</sub> = x<sub>7</sub> = 0
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>3. Probabilities</h4>
                There will be cases where no safe inferences can be made. 
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/prob-case.png">
                    <img src="./images/prob-case-matrix.png">
                    <figcaption>What guesses can we make in this situation?</figcaption>
                </figure>
                Ultimately, we can treat Minesweeper as a game of chance: each tile we step on has a chance of being a mine. A none-mine tile gives probabilities of its neighbors being mines. <br>
                How do we calculate this probability <img src="./assets/quest.png"> <br>
                Probability for neighbors surround a single known tile is very simple:<b> p =  <sup># of mines</sup>&frasl;<sub># of open neighbors</sub> </b>.
                But if an open tile is under influence of 2 or more known tiles, it could get tricky. <br>
                My attempts to apply a Bayesian model didn't go very well, so I decided to brute force my way to the solution. Literally. <br>
                If we generate all possible solutions for all open tiles near known tiles (edge tiles), the probability of a given edge tile being a mine is: <br>
                <h5 style="text-align: center"><b>p = <sup># of valid solutions contain a mine at current location</sup>&frasl;<sub># all valid solutions</sub> <br></b></h5>
                The classic way of brute force through all solutions would be troublesome, since it has to check <b>2<sup># of edge tiles</sup></b> solutions and pick out valid ones.
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/brute-force-classic.png">
                    <figcaption>There are 2<sup>44</sup> = 17,592,186,044,416 (17 trillions) solutions to be checked for this board piece</figcaption>
                </figure>
                To improve the algorithm, we can apply some <b>divide and conquer</b>: generate solutions for each row in the RREF matrix, then combine them. 
                This way, only the valid solutions are considered during the merge phase. For example:
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/merge.png">
                    <img src="./images/merge-matrix.png">
                </figure>
                In this case, there are 8 variables for 8 open tiles. Brute forcing would require 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 iterations. <br>
                Genrating solutions for first row requires 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 iterations. Output 3 valid solutions.<br>
                Genrating solutions for second row requires 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 iterations. Output 5 valid solutions. <br>
                Merging solutions by cross multiplication requires 3 * 5 = 15 iterations. <br>
                Total iterations by divide and conquer: 8 + 32 + 15 = 55 &lt; 256 iterations. <br><br>
                We can further improve the algorithm by divide the edge tiles into groups. <br> 
                If 2 known tiles have overlapping neighbors, all of their neighbors are grouped since they have influence to each other's probability of having a mine. <br>
                Since each group don't have any influence to one another, we can calculate their probabilities individually without cross multiplying.
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/merge2.png">
                    <img src="./images/merge2-marked.png">
                    <img src="./images/merge2-matrix.png">
                </figure>
                For this instance, we can divide edge tiles into 2 groups. Let's go through the calculations: <br>
                Row 1: 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 iterations output 10 solutions. <br>
                Row 2: 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 iterations output 28 solutions. <br>
                Row 3: 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 iterations output 3 solutions. <br>
                Total by previous algorithm: 32 + 256 + 8 + 10 * 28 * 3 = 1136 iterations. <br>
                Total by group partition: 32 + 256 + 8 + 28 * 3 = 380 iterations. <br>
